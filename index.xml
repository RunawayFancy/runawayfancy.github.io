      <description>Seminar of Physics in UMThe seminar of Physics in the University of Macau was held by Yichen LUI and me in March, 2022. We aimed at enhancing the basic and advanced topics of fundamental physics and mathematics.Minecraft, Redstone and EditingI&#39;m a redstone technological Minecraft player focusing on mechanical design and game mechanism which are helpful in survival mode. Some showcase videos are edited for presentations.</description>

      <description>About I collected and summarized several notes from physics and mathematics courses during my undergraduate learning period. Most of them are referred to famous textbooks and lecture notes of online open courses. Unfortunately, most of the notes are handwritten and maybe I will rebuild them into $\LaTeX$ versions.

      <description>Quantum Physics
A quantum algorithm for collision inducing disturbance vectors in SHA-1
Advisor: Prof. Hou IAN
Seeding a disturbance vector in the has mapping to obtain a successful collision is a major focus of cryptographic study in the past two decades to improve hash protocols. We propose an algorithm that takes advantage of entangled quantum states for concurrent seeding of candidate disturbance vectors, out of which the one entailing collision is selected thought a combination of Grover search , phase-gate, and information feedbacks form classical computing machinery.</description>

      <description>About The seminar on physics at the University of Macau (SPUM), founded by Yichen LIU and me, aims at improving the education of fundamental and advanced physics mathematics. Students who have strong and wide knowledge in a specific area can admit to being a lecturer. Our organization is unofficial therefore we only invite students who have interests and talents in physics and mathematics study and research. Students are required to have a strong basis in calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations (ordinary and partial).</description>
