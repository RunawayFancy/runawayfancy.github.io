Blumenthal, C. Mor, A. A. Diringer, L. S. Martin, P. Lewalle, D. Burgarth, K. B. Whaley, and S. Hacohen-Gourgy Motivation Using superconducting qubit to demonstrate quantum zeno effect.\nQuantum Zeno effect An effect lies on the boundary between coherent and incoherent control of a quantum system, in which frequent measurements effectively freeze the system dynamics, holding the system at an eigenstate of the measurement observable.\nMethod A qutrit and a qubit inside a resonator, no interaction between qutrit and qubit. See Fig. 1 $q_1$: qutrit, $q_2$: qubit $\\varepsilon$ is the microwave pulse driving the resonator, at frequency $\\omega_{fe}$ $\\omega_{fe}$ is the resonator frequency when $|q_1, q_2\\rangle = |f,e\\rangle$, the dispersive shift. $\\Omega_R$ is the microwave pulse driving the qutrit state $|e\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |f\\rangle$ The driving of resonator is effective to be a measurement of the projection operator $P = 1 - |fe\\rangle\\langle fe|$ (frequently excite the cavity and measure at frequency $\\omega_{fe}$, equivalent to frequently apply the measurement of the projection operator $P$). The Zeno Hamiltonian becomes $$ H_{\\text{Zeno}} = PHP = i\\hbar \\frac{\\Omega_R}{2} \\left( |eg\\rangle\\langle fg | - | fg \\rangle \\langle eg | \\right) $$ where $H = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\Omega_R \\left( |e \\rangle\\langle f| - |f \\rangle\\langle e| \\right) \\otimes \\left(g | \\rangle\\langle g| + |e \\rangle\\langle e| \\right)$\nWe see the Zeno Hamiltonian describe a Rabi between $|eg\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |fg\\rangle$, and block the $|ee\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |fe\\rangle$ transition. This restrict the system into a computational subspace, shown as the color region in Fig. 1(b). This can also be done for multiple qubit system. $P = 1 - |feee\\cdots\\rangle\\langle feee\\cdots|$ Experiment The system Hamiltonian without Zeno drive and Rabi drive is a dispersive Hamiltonian in the interaction picture $$ H_{\\text{disp}}\\hbar = \\left( \\Chi_1 |e_1\\rangle\\langle e_1 | + \\Chi_2 | e_2 \\rangle\\langle e_2 | + \\Chi_f | f \\rangle\\langle f| \\right) a^\\dagger a + \\alpha_1 |f\\rangle\\langle f| $$ where $\\Chi_i$ is the dispersive shift, $\\alpha_i$ is the anharmonicity.\nDespite the Zeno drive at $\\omega_{fe}$, a symmetric drive which is symmetric to the Zeno measurement drive frequency with respect to $\\omega_{eg}$ and $\\omega_{ge}$ are added. This symmetric drive balances the phase accumulation, such that this no longer generates entanglement. The system Hamiltonian with Zeno and symmetric driving under the rotating frame of $\\omega_{gg}$ is $$ H/\\hbar = H_{disp}/\\hbar + i\\varepsilon \\left( a e^{-i(\\Chi_f + \\Chi_2)t} - a^\\dagger e^{i(\\Chi_f + \\Chi_2)t} \\right) + i\\varepsilon \\left( a e^{-i(\\Chi_2 - \\Chi_f)t} - a^\\dagger e^{i(\\Chi_2 - \\Chi_f)t} \\right) $$\nExperiment result could refer to this paper. Here we skip it. Residual effects of the Zeno drive Refer to the Sec. Residual effect of the Zeno drive The coherence will be lost due to measurement-induced dephasing at a rate. The Zeno drive only will cause entanglement, which is the reason for adding additional symmetric drive.

Using electron spins to refocus variations of interactions (quadrupole and hyperfine) to achieve long nuclear spin free evolution. Known as unbalanced echo. This unbalanced echo technique and be used to sensing temperature and strain variations in materials with nanoscale resolution. Unbalanced echo It involves flipping an ancillary qubit (here the N-V electronic spin) midway through the free precession period of the target qubit (here the nitrogen nuclear spin).\nThe flip time $\\tau$ is asymmetric - it does not split the free precession time t into two equal halves, hence “unbalanced”.\nThis echo sequence cancelles out low-frequency noise from interaction variations, acting like a spin echo.\nHowever, it preserves the useful quantum phase information accumulated during the free precession, unlike a regular spin echo.\nSetup system The system diagram and energy levels are shown in Fig.1 (a). The nuclear spin (n spin) is qubit and N-V center electron spin (e spin) is bath. e spin state is switched between $|m_S = 0\\rangle$ and $| m_S = \\pm 1 \\rangle$. n spin contains single quantum (SQ) transitions between $|m_I = 0\\rangle$ and $|m_I = \\pm \\rangle$ which have six different frequencies: $\\omega_{1,2} |Q| \\pm |\\gamma_n B|$, $\\omega_{3,4} = |Q| \\mp |A_{zz}| \\pm |\\gamma_n B|$, and $\\omega_{5,6} = |Q| \\pm |A_{zz}| \\pm |\\gamma_n B|$, corresponding to the electron spin state $|m_S = 0\\rangle$, $|m_S = -1\\rangle$, and $|m_S = +1\\rangle$, respectively. In a magnetic field $B$ aligned with the N-V center, the Hamiltonian of nuclear spin is given by $$ H_n = Q I^2_z + m_S A_{zz}I_z + \\gamma_n B I_z $$ where $I_z$ is the spin-1 $z$ operator, and we assume the N-V electronic spin is in its eigenstate $|m_S\\rangle$. Pulse sequence The pulse sequence are shown in Fig.1 (b). The N-V center electron are polarized to state $|m_S = 0, m_I = +1\\rangle$ by a laser pulse. The nuclear spin state $(|0\\rangle + |\\pm 1\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ is prepared with a $\\pi/2$ pulse (notice that ``$m_I = $’’ is omitted here for simplicity). Suppose we prepare nuclear spin state $(|0\\rangle + |- 1\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ and drive the spin state between $|m_S = 0\\rangle$ and $|m_S = \\pm 1\\rangle$. The free evolution of nuclear spin state after time $t$ is given by $|\\psi(t)\\rangle = (|0\\rangle + e^{i\\phi}|-1\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ with an accumulated quantum phase $\\phi = \\omega t$. At time $t - \\tau$, we apply a $\\pi$ pulse on the spin state, flipping the spin state from $|m_S = 0\\rangle$ to $|m_S = \\pm 1\\rangle$, turning the level frequency from $|Q| - |\\gamma_n B|$ to $|Q| \\mp |A_{zz}| - |\\gamma_n B|$. The accumulated phase and dephasing till now is $ \\phi_0 + \\delta\\phi = -(|Q|-|\\gamma_n B|)(t - \\tau) + (\\delta|Q| + \\gamma_n \\delta|B|)(t - \\tau) $ where $\\delta$ means variation. Why there is a minus sign behind $\\phi_0$ ??? And why there is a plus sign behind the $\\delta B$ term ??? At time $t$, we apply another $\\pi$ pulse on the spin state, flipping the spin state back to $|m_S = 0\\rangle$. turning the level frequency back to $|Q| - |\\gamma_n B|$. The accumulated phase and depasing in time interval $[t-\\tau, t]$ is $\\phi_0’ + \\delta\\phi’ = -(|Q| \\mp |A_{zz}| - |\\gamma_n B|)\\tau + (\\delta|Q| \\mp \\delta|A_{zz}| - \\gamma_n \\delta|B|)\\tau$. Assume the flipped electron state is $|\\m_S = +1\\rangle$. The total accumulated phase and dephasing is given by $\\phi = \\phi_0 + \\phi_0’ + \\delta \\phi + \\delta \\phi’$. In optically addressed solid-state spin ensembles, the laser heating introduces temperature variations $\\delta T$. This temperature variation will induce the variation in quadrupole and hyperfine interaction (assume the variation of the magnetic file $\\delta B$ is minimized when designing the experimental setup, and the small gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma_n/\\gamma_r \\sim 10^{-4}$ introduces negligible coupling to the magnetic noise). Therefore, one correlation can be made by expressing $\\delta Q = \\alpha_Q \\delta T$ and $\\delta A_{zz} = \\alpha_A \\delta T$. The total phase accumulation and dephasing becomes $$ \\begin{aligned} \\phi (\\delta T) \u0026amp;= \\varphi_0 + \\delta\\varphi \\ \u0026amp;= -t Q + \\tau A_{zz} + \\gamma_n B t - (t\\alpha_Q - \\tau\\alpha_A)\\delta T, \\end{aligned} $$ where $\\varphi = -t Q + \\tau A_{zz} + \\gamma_n B t$ and $\\delta \\varphi = - (t\\alpha_Q - \\tau\\alpha_A)\\delta T$. If the pulse location $\\tau/t$ is set to the ratio $\\alpha_Q/\\alpha_A$, the noise (dephasing) $\\delta \\varphi$ can will be completely canceled while the static part $\\varphi_0$ still …","date":1694649600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694649600,"objectID":"f5bf4e95f1d2e1b4ef5ba6cc40e10da1","permalink":"https://runawayfancy.github.io/blog/reading_paper/reading_paper_20230914/","publishdate":"2023-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/reading_paper/reading_paper_20230914/","section":"blog","summary":"Characterizing temperature and strain variations with qubit ensembles for their robust coherence protection","tags":["Academic","Quantum Physics","Quantum Information Science"],"title":"Reading Paper 20230914","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Jiheng Duan 段繼恆"],"categories":["Blog"],"content":"Cherent Manipulation of Coupled Electron Spins in Semiconductor Quantum Dots Jiheng Duan, jiheng.duan@rochester.edu, 09/03/2023\nPaper Information DOI: 10.1126/science.111.6955 Date: 30, Sept., 2005 Author: J.

Two tunnel barries (control left gate voltage $V_L$ and right gate voltage $V_R$) control the detuning to allow electron move in or out the dot. Detuning parameter $\\epsilon \\propto V_R - V_L$. The detuning parameter $\\epsilon$ controls the system state. Qubit infor See Fig.2.\nSystem cycle: shown in Fig.2A.

Measurement: using quantum point contact sensor. Details see next section. Manipulation: by change detuning $\\epsilon$; A fixed z-direction B-field to induce Zeeman splitting. Four significant region (see Fig.2B): $\\epsilon\u0026gt;0$: system at $(0,2)S$, two spin are in one potential wall. $(m,n)$ is a notation of charge state, where $m,n$ represents the number of electrons inside the left and right dots, respectively. $\\epsilon_{T+} \\approx \\epsilon \u0026lt; 0$: $S$ state resonant with $T_+$ state. $\\epsilon_{T+} \u0026gt; \\epsilon$: $S$ state hybrids with $T_0$, with a exchange interaction strength $J(\\epsilon)$. $\\epsilon « J(0)$: Avoid crossing induced by spin-nuclei hyperfine interaction, with spacing $J(\\epsilon) = g^*\\mu_B B_{nuc} \\rightarrow 0$.

In this paper, $B{\\text{nuc}} \\sim 1$ to $5$ mT. Measurement Measurement, which is a projective measurement, is based on the spin-blockaded transition technique. A Singlet-Triplet qubit state (spin state) measurement is achieved by switching the detuning $\\epsilon$ from negative value to positive, which will map $S$ to $(0,2)S$ charge state and $T_0$ (or $T_\\pm$, depends on which state you are considered as computational state) remain in $(1,1)$, a spin-blocked configuration.

Lett. 131.050601 Jiheng Duan, jiheng.duan@rochester.edu, 08/24/2023\nTitle Approximate Autonomous Quantum Error Correction with Reinforcement Learning\nAbstract Approximate Autonomous Quantum Error Correction (AAQEC) 利用了人为制造的耗散二能级系统对任意qubit态$|\\Psi_{\\theta \\phi}\\rangle$进行自动QEC. 这篇文章里，用到了bosonic system去制造这样的code space（逻辑比特），并且使用一个auxiliary qubit作为人为制造的耗散二能级系统，来实现对code space的AAQEC。auxiliary qubit的引入实际上是引入了一个Lindblad operator $L_{eng}$, 它将逻辑比特的量子态从error space转回code space。这种AAQEC的protocol（code space）的设计优化用到了reinforcement learning (RL)，及在经典计算机下进行模拟，通过RL返回控制优化mean fidelity $\\bar{F}(|0_L\\rangle, |1_L\\rangle)$ 以找到protocol所需的logic zero $|0_L\\rangle$ and one $|1_L \\rangle$ 的最优解。注意这里的$|0_L\\rangle$ and $|1_L\\rangle$ 是满足近似Knill-Laflamme (KL) conditions的（正文Eq.(2)上方的段落内）。这样的protocol对逻辑门的Hamiltonian distance的要求为$d_g = 2$,及需要couple $|n\\rangle$ 和 $|n + 2\\rangle$ 两个态来实现逻辑门操作。同时，此protocol对engineered Lindblad operator $L_{eng}$的Hamiltonian distance为$d=1$。比如，当$|0_L\\rangle \\approx |4\\rangle$ and $|1_L\\rangle \\approx |2\\rangle$, $L_{eng} \\propto |2\\rangle \\langle 1| + |4\\rangle \\langle 3|$ (single photon loss). 对应的logical Pauli operator 为 $\\sigma_x = |2\\rangle \\langle 4| + |4\\rangle \\langle 2 |$, $\\sigma_y = i(|4\\rangle \\langle 2| - |2\\rangle \\langle 4 |)$, and $\\sigma_z = |2\\rangle \\langle 2| - |4\\rangle \\langle 4 |$。\nCode Space and dynamics 假设一个bosonic system和一个理想的auxiliary qubit couple在一起，bosonic system视为一个logical qubit，其logic zero and one 如下定义 $$ |0_L\\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}c_n^{(0)} |4n\\rangle, \\ |1_L\\rangle = \\sum_{n=0} c_n^{(1)} |4n+2\\rangle, $$ where $c_n^{(0)}$ and $c_n^{(1)}$ 是real coefficients，满足$\\sum_n|c_n^{(u)}|^2 =1$ $(u = 0,1)$。 qubit的single photon decay rate是$\\gamma_b$, bosonic system的single photon loss rate 为$\\gamma_a$。两个系统couple在一起，我们定义一个QEC jump operator，也就是我们之前提到的engineered Lindblad operator $$ L_{eng} = \\sum_{|d_l|\\le d} \\sum_n \\lambda_{nd_l} |n\\rangle \\langle n+ d_l |, $$ where $d_l$ 是Hamiltonian distance。我们的系统的时间演化由如下的master equation描述 $$ \\frac{d \\rho}{d t} = -i\\left[ H_{eff}, \\rho \\right] + \\frac{\\gamma_a}{2}\\mathcal{D}[a] + \\frac{\\gamma_b}{2}\\mathcal{D}[\\sigma_-], $$ where the effective Hamiltonian $H_{eff}= g(L_{eng}\\sigma_+ + L_{eng}^\\dagger \\sigma_-)$, the superoperator $\\mathcal{D}[ x] = 2x\\rho x^\\dagger - x^\\dagger x \\rho - \\rho x^\\dagger x$, and $\\rho$ is the system’s density matrix. Notice that we assume $\\gamma_a, g \\ll \\gamma_b$, and $\\gamma_a \\ll g$.\n如此，我们可以assume一些系统动力学的演化路径。我们的初始态，也就是code space为$|\\Psi_{\\theta\\phi},0\\rangle$。 对于single photon loss 导致的error，我们有如下两种路径，在如下的图展示出来： 或者从如下图FIG 1.(a) 可以看出来系统的耦合状态。 Optimization Code Space 通过RL，QUTIP在经典计算机下对$|0_L\\rangle $ and $|1_L\\rangle$ 中的系数$c_n^{(0)}$ and $c_n^{(1)}$进行优化，以让mean fidelity达到最小值。细节参考文章 Sec.

The flux control requires sending flux pulses with desired waveform to bias the flux inside the SQUID loop. But many devices and imperfections can distort the waveform, inducing undesired flux fluctuations. Such waveform distortions will cause inaccurate frequency biasing or frequency damping, which leads to phase errors accumulation of a qubit (or coupler) and decrease the fidelity of qubit Z-control (e.g., iSWAP gate and CZ gate).\nThe distortions comes from many sources: analog filters (e.g., low-pass filter, high-pass filter), Bias-Tee, AWG, junction points on the transmission line (causing transmission and reflection of the EM wave), skin effect, on-chip resonance, etc.\nWe aim at exploring new techniques of combining reinforcement learning with digital inverse filtering methods (inverse IIR, and FIR filters), to effective and fast calibrate and fix the distortions. The predistortion method uses inversed digital filters, calibrated by the transient analysis of each components contributing distortions, to predistort the flux pulse inside the AWG, and all distortions can be countered.\nThis technique will be widely applied in future, and we are currently developing the inverse filter calibration code and the reinforcement learning model.\n","date":1688601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688601600,"objectID":"472dde093b099f6b7cefa544ad101ec0","permalink":"https://runawayfancy.github.io/research/predistortion/","publishdate":"2023-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/predistortion/","section":"research","summary":"Exploring predistortion methods to fix distortions on the flux pulses used in Z-control of flux tunable superconducting qubits.","tags":["Quantum Computing"],"title":"Exploring Flux Pulse Predistortion Methods","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Modern cryptographic protocols rely on sophisticated hash functions to generate quasi-unique numbers that serve as signatures for user authentication and other security verifications.

Seeding a disturbance vector in the hash mapping to obtain a successful collision is that a major focus of cryptography study in the past two decades to improve hash protocols. We propose an algorithm that takes advantage of entangled quantum states for concurrent seeding of candidate disturbance vectors, out of which the one entailing collision is selected through a combination of quantum search, phase gating, diffusion gating, and information feedbacks from classical computing machinery.
