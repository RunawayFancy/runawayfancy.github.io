The flux control requires sending flux pulses with desired waveform to bias the flux inside the SQUID loop. But many devices and imperfections can distort the waveform, inducing undesired flux fluctuations. Such waveform distortions will cause inaccurate frequency biasing or frequency damping, which leads to phase errors accumulation of a qubit (or coupler) and decrease the fidelity of qubit Z-control (e.g., iSWAP gate and CZ gate).\nThe distortions comes from many sources: analog filters (e.g., low-pass filter, high-pass filter), Bias-Tee, AWG, junction points on the transmission line (causing transmission and reflection of the EM wave), skin effect, on-chip resonance, etc.\nWe aim at exploring new techniques of combining reinforcement learning with digital inverse filtering methods (inverse IIR, and FIR filters), to effective and fast calibrate and fix the distortions. The predistortion method uses inversed digital filters, calibrated by the transient analysis of each components contributing distortions, to predistort the flux pulse inside the AWG, and all distortions can be countered.\nThis technique will be widely applied in future, and we are currently developing the inverse filter calibration code and the reinforcement learning model.\n","date":1688601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688601600,"objectID":"472dde093b099f6b7cefa544ad101ec0","permalink":"https://runawayfancy.github.io/research/predistortion/","publishdate":"2023-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/predistortion/","section":"research","summary":"Exploring predistortion methods to fix distortions on the flux pulses used in Z-control of flux tunable superconducting qubits.","tags":["Quantum Computing"],"title":"Exploring Flux Pulse Predistortion Methods","type":"research"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Modern cryptographic protocols rely on sophisticated hash functions to generate quasi-unique numbers that serve as signatures for user authentication and other security verifications. The security could be compromised by finding texts hash-mappable to identical numbers, forming so-called collision attack. Seeding a disturbance vector in the hash mapping to obtain a successful collision is that a major focus of cryptography study in the past two decades to improve hash protocols. We propose an algorithm that takes advantage of entangled quantum states for concurrent seeding of candidate disturbance vectors, out of which the one entailing collision is selected through a combination of quantum search, phase gating, diffusion gating, and information feedbacks from classical computing machinery. The complexity reduction is shown to be on the order of $O(2^{n/2+1})$ where n is the number of qubits encoding addresses.

A controllable phase to align the carrier and the amplitude envelope thus becomes essential.
